abstract = {Thompson Sampling is one of the oldest heuristics for multi-armed bandit problems. It is a randomized algorithm based on Bayesian ideas, and has recently generated significant interest after several studies demonstrated it to have comparable or better empirical performance compared to the state of the art methods. In this paper, we provide a novel regret analysis for Thompson Sampling that proves the first near-optimal problem-independent bound of O($\backslash$sqrtNT$\backslash$ln T) on the expected regret of this algorithm. Our novel martingale-based analysis techniques are conceptually simple, and easily extend to distributions other than the Beta distribution. For the version of Thompson Sampling that uses Gaussian priors, we prove a problem-independent bound of O($\backslash$sqrtNT$\backslash$ln N) on the expected regret, and demonstrate the optimality of this bound by providing a matching lower bound. This lower bound of $\Omega$($\backslash$sqrtNT$\backslash$ln N) is the first lower bound on the performance of a natural version of Thompson Sampling that is away from the general lower bound of O($\backslash$sqrtNT) for the multi-armed bandit problem. Our near-optimal problem-independent bounds for Thompson Sampling solve a COLT 2012 open problem of Chapelle and Li. Additionally, our techniques simultaneously provide the optimal problem-dependent bound of (1+$\epsilon$)$\backslash$sum{\_}i $\backslash$frac$\backslash$ln Td($\mu${\_}i, $\mu${\_}1)+O($\backslash$fracN$\epsilon${\^{}}2) on the expected regret. The optimal problem-dependent regret bound for this problem was first proven recently by Kaufmann et al. [2012].},

abstract = {Algorithms based on upper confidence bounds for balancing exploration and exploitation are gaining popularity since they are easy to implement, efficient and effective. This paper considers a variant of the basic algorithm for the stochastic, multi-armed bandit problem that takes into account the empirical variance of the different arms. In earlier experimental works, such algorithms were found to outperform the competing algorithms. We provide the first analysis of the expected regret for such algorithms. As expected, our results show that the algorithm that uses the variance estimates has a major advantage over its alternatives that do not use such estimates provided that the variances of the payoffs of the suboptimal arms are low. We also prove that the regret concentrates only at a polynomial rate. This holds for all the upper confidence bound based algorithms and for all bandit problems except those special ones where with probability one the payoff obtained by pulling the optimal arm is larger than the expected payoff for the second best arm. Hence, although upper confidence bound bandit algorithms achieve logarithmic expected regret rates, they might not be suitable for a risk-averse decision maker. We illustrate some of the results by computer simulations. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning policies face the exploration versus exploitation dilemma, i.e. the search for a balance between exploring the environment to find profitable actions while taking the empirically best action as often as possible. A popular measure of a policy's success in addressing this dilemma is the regret, that is the loss due to the fact that the globally optimal policy is not followed all the times. One of the simplest examples of the exploration/exploitation dilemma is the multi-armed bandit problem. Lai and Robbins were the first ones to show that the regret for this problem has to grow at least logarithmically in the number of plays. Since then, policies which asymptotically achieve this regret have been devised by Lai and Robbins and many others. In this work we show that the optimal logarithmic regret is also achievable uniformly over time, with simple and efficient policies, and for all reward distributions with bounded support.},

@article{auer2002nonstochastic,
abstract = {In the multiarmed bandit problem, a gambler must decide which arm of K non-identical slot machines to play in a sequence of trials so as to maximize his reward. This classical problem has received much attention because of the simple model it provides of the trade-off between exploration (trying out each arm to find the best one) and exploitation (playing the arm believed to give the best payoff). Past solutions for the bandit problem have almost always relied on assumptions about the statistics of the slot machines. In this work, we make no statistical assumptions whatsoever about the nature of the process generating the payoffs of the slot machines. We give a solution to the bandit problem in which an adversary, rather than a well-behaved stochastic process, has complete control over the payoffs. In a sequence of T plays, we prove that the per-round payoff of our algorithm approaches that of the best arm at the rate O(T-1/2). We show by a matching lower bound that this is the best possible. We also prove that our algorithm approaches the per-round payoff of any set of strategies at a similar rate: if the best strategy is chosen from a pool of N strategies, then our algorithm approaches the per-round payoff of the strategy at the rate O((log N)1/2T-1/2). Finally, we apply our results to the problem of playing an unknown repeated matrix game. We show that our algorithm approaches the minimax payoff of the unknown game at the rate O(T-1/2).},

Initially dedicated to the study of High Performance Computing, the infrastructure has evolved to address wider concerns related to Desktop Computing, the Internet of Services and more recently the Cloud Computing paradigm. This paper present recent improvements of the Grid'5000 software and services stack to support large-scale experiments using virtualization technologies as building blocks. Such contributions include the deployment of customized software environments, the reservation of dedicated network domain and the possibility to isolate them from the others, and the automation of experiments with a REST API. We illustrate the interest of these contributions by describing three different use-cases of large-scale experiments on the Grid'5000 testbed. The first one leverages virtual machines to conduct larger experiments spread over 4000 peers. The second one describes the deployment of 10000 KVM instances over 4 Grid'5000 sites. Finally, the last use case introduces a one-click deployment tool to easily deploy major IaaS solutions.

A well-known technique to obtain an anytime algorithm from any non-anytime algorithm is the "Doubling Trick". In the context of adversarial or stochastic multi-armed bandits, the performance of an algorithm is measured by its regret, and we study two families of sequences of growing horizons (geometric and exponential) to generalize previously known results that certain doubling tricks can be used to conserve certain regret bounds. In a broad setting, we prove that a geometric doubling trick can be used to conserve (minimax) bounds in {\$}R\backslash{\_}T = O(\backslashsqrt{\{}T{\}}){\$} but cannot conserve (distribution-dependent) bounds in {\$}R\backslash{\_}T = O(\backslashlog T){\$}. We give insights as to why exponential doubling tricks may be better, as they conserve bounds in {\$}R\backslash{\_}T = O(\backslashlog T){\$}, and are close to conserving bounds in {\$}R\backslash{\_}T = O(\backslashsqrt{\{}T{\}}){\$}.},

Contrary to many related works, we provide rigorous guarantees of performance, as bounds on the rates of false positives and false negatives. Using ideas from data stream algorithmics, we develop a time-and memory-efficient version of this algorithm, called ADWIN2. We show how to combine ADWIN2 with the Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes (NB) predictor, in two ways: one, using it to monitor the error rate of the current model and declare when revision is necessary and, two, putting it inside the NB predictor to maintain up-to-date estimations of conditional probabilities in the data.

Soc. Ser. B Stat. Methodol. 41 (1979) 148–177], based on upper confidence bounds of the arm payoffs computed using the Kullback–Leibler divergence. We consider two classes of distributions for which instances of this general idea are analyzed: the kl-UCB algorithm is designed for one-parameter exponential families and the empirical KL-UCB algorithm for bounded and finitely supported distributions. Our main contribution is a unified finite-time analysis of the regret of these algorithms that asymptotically matches the lower bounds of Lai and Robbins [Adv. in Appl. Math. 6 (1985) 4–22] and Burnetas and Katehakis [Adv. in Appl. Math. 17 (1996) 122–142], respectively. We also investigate the behavior of these algorithms when used with general bounded rewards, showing in particular that they provide significant improvements over the state-of-the-art.},

We prove that any bandit strategy, for at least one bandit problem characterized by a complexity H, will misidentify the best arm with probability lower bounded by {\$}\backslashexp\backslashBig(-\backslashfrac{\{}T{\}}\backslashlog(K)H\backslashBig){\$}, where {\$}H{\$} is the sum for all sub-optimal arms of the inverse of the squared gaps. Our result disproves formally the general belief - coming from results in the fixed confidence setting - that there must exist an algorithm for this problem whose probability of error is upper bounded by {\$}\backslashexp(-T/H){\$}. This also proves that some existing strategies based on the Successive Rejection of the arms are optimal - closing therefore the current gap between upper and lower bounds for the fixed budget best arm identification problem.},

abstract = {In multi-armed bandits, the most common objective is the maximization of the cumulative reward. Alternative settings include active exploration, where a learner tries to gain accurate estimates of the rewards of all arms. While these objectives are contrasting, in many scenarios it is desirable to trade off rewards and errors. For instance, in educational games the designer wants to gather generalizable knowledge about the behavior of the students and teaching strategies (small estimation errors) but, at the same time, the system needs to avoid giving a bad experience to the players, who may leave the system permanently (large reward). In this paper, we formalize this tradeoff and introduce the ForcingBalance algorithm whose performance is provably close to the best possible tradeoff strategy. Finally, we demonstrate on real-world educational data that ForcingBalance returns useful information about the arms without compromising the overall reward.},

We establish an upper-bound for the expected regret by upper-bounding the expectation of the number of times suboptimal arms are played. The proof relies on an interesting Hoeffding type inequality for self normalized deviations with a random number of summands. We establish a lower-bound for the regret in presence of abrupt changes in the arms reward distributions. We show that the discounted UCB and the sliding-window UCB both match the lower-bound up to a logarithmic factor.

We assume that the arm-dependent rates at which the rewards change are unknown to the decision maker, and propose algorithms with provably optimal policy regret bounds, a much stronger notion than the often-studied external regret. For the case where the rewards are increasing and concave, we give an algorithm whose policy regret is sublinear and has a (provably necessary) dependence on the time required to distinguish the optimal arm from the rest. We illustrate the behavior and performance of this algorithm via simulations. For the decreasing case, we present a simple greedy approach and show that the policy regret of this algorithm is constant and upper bounded by the number of arms.},

We show in this paper that methods derived from this second perspective prove optimal when evaluated using the frequentist cumulated regret as a measure of performance. We give a general formulation for a class of Bayesian index policies that rely on quantiles of the posterior distribution. For binary bandits, we prove that the corresponding algorithm, termed Bayes-UCB, satisfies finite-time regret bounds that imply its asymptotic optimality. More generally, Bayes-UCB appears as an unifying framework for several variants of the UCB algorithm addressing different bandit problems (parametric multi-armed bandits, Gaussian bandits with unknown mean and variance, linear bandits). But the generality of the Bayesian approach makes it possible to address more challenging models. In particular, we show how to handle linear bandits with sparsity constraints by resorting to Gibbs sampling.},

abstract = {In theoretical cognitive science, there is a tension between highly structured models whose parameters have a direct psychological interpretation and highly complex, general-purpose models whose parameters and representations are difficult to interpret. The former typically provide more insight into cognition but the latter often perform better. This tension has recently surfaced in the realm of educational data mining, where a deep learning approach to predicting students' performance as they work through a series of exercises—termed deep knowledge tracing or DKT—has demonstrated a stunning performance advantage over the mainstay of the field, Bayesian knowledge tracing or BKT. In this article, we attempt to understand the basis for DKT's advantage by considering the sources of statistical regularity in the data that DKT can leverage but which BKT cannot. We hypothesize four forms of regularity that BKT fails to exploit: recency effects, the contextualized trial sequence, inter-skill similarity, and individual variation in ability. We demonstrate that when BKT is extended to allow it more flexibility in modeling statistical regularities—using extensions previously proposed in the literature—BKT achieves a level of performance indistinguishable from that of DKT. We argue that while DKT is a powerful, useful, general-purpose framework for modeling student learning, its gains do not come from the discovery of novel representations—the fundamental advantage of deep learning. To answer the question posed in our title, knowledge tracing may be a domain that does not require ‘depth'; shallow models like BKT can perform just as well and offer us greater interpretability and explanatory power.},

abstract = {Contents displayed on web portals (e.g., news articles at Yahoo.com) are usually adaptively selected from a dynamic set of candidate items, and the attractiveness of each item decays over time. The goal of those websites is to maximize the engagement of users (usually measured by their clicks) on the selected items. We formulate this kind of applications as a new variant of bandit problems where new arms are dynamically added into the candidate set and the expected reward of each arm decays as the round proceeds. For this new problem, a direct application of the algorithms designed for stochastic MAB (e.g., UCB) will lead to over-estimation of the rewards of old arms, and thus cause a misidentification of the optimal arm. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new algorithm that can adaptively estimate the temporal dynamics in the rewards of the arms, and effectively identify the best arm at a given time point on this basis. When the temporal dynamics are represented by a set of features, the proposed algorithm is able to enjoy a sub-linear regret. Our experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

We study the problem of selecting the best personalized learning action that each student should take next given their learning history; possible actions could include reading a textbook section, watching a lecture video, interacting with a simulation or lab, solving a practice question, and so on. We first estimate each student's knowledge profile from their binary-valued graded responses to questions in their previous assessments using the SPARFA framework. We then employ these knowledge profiles as contexts in the contextual (multi-armed) bandits framework to learn a policy that selects the personalized learning actions that maximize each student's immediate success, i.e., their performance on their next assessment. We develop two algorithms for personalized learning action selection. While one is mainly of theoretical interest, we experimentally validate the other using a real-world educational dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior or comparable performance as compared to existing algorithms in terms of maximizing the students' immediate success.},

In the classical MAB problem, a decision maker must choose an arm at each time step, upon which she receives a reward. The decision maker's objective is to maximize her cumulative expected reward over the time horizon. The MAB problem has been studied extensively, specifically under the assumption of the arms' rewards distributions being stationary, or quasi-stationary, over time. We consider a variant of the MAB framework, which we termed Rotting Bandits, where each arm's expected reward decays as a function of the number of times it has been pulled. We are motivated by many real-world scenarios such as online advertising , content recommendation, crowdsourcing, and more.

This observation makes the relationships between many commonly used algorithms explicit, and provides theoretical insight on previous experimental observations. In particular, even though the FOBOS composite mirror descent algorithm handles L 1 regularization explicitly, it has been observed that the FTRL-style Regularized Dual Averaging (RDA) algorithm is even more effective at producing sparsity. Our results demonstrate that the key difference between these algorithms is how they handle the cumulative L 1 penalty. While FOBOS handles the L 1 term exactly on any given update, we show that it is effectively using subgradient approximations to the L 1 penalty from previous rounds, leading to less sparsity than RDA, which handles the cumulative penalty in closed form. The FTRL-Proximal algorithm, which we introduce, can be seen as a hybrid of these two algorithms, and significantly outperforms both on a large, real-world dataset. Copyright 2011 by the authors.},

Diverging from previous works, we assume the more realistic scenario that there can be undetectable changepoint gaps and under a different set of assumptions, we show that as long as the compounded delayed detection for each changepoint is bounded there is no need for forced exploration to actively detect changepoints. We introduce two adaptations of UCB-strategies that employ scan-statistics in order to actively detect the changepoints, without knowing in advance the changepoints and also the mean before and after any change. Our first method $\backslash$UCBLCPD does not know the number of changepoints {\$}G{\$} or time horizon {\$}T{\$} and achieves the first time-uniform concentration bound for this setting using the Laplace method of integration.

In this paper we explore the utility of using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to model student learning. The RNN family of models have important advantages over previous methods in that they do not require the explicit encoding of human domain knowledge, and can capture more complex representations of student knowledge. Using neural networks results in substantial improvements in prediction performance on a range of knowledge tracing datasets. Moreover the learned model can be used for intelligent curriculum design and allows straightforward interpretation and discovery of structure in student tasks. These results suggest a promising new line of research for knowledge tracing and an exemplary application task for RNNs.},

In online education there is the potential to develop personalized and adaptive learning environments, where students can receive individualized sequences of questions which update as the student is observed to be struggling or flourishing. In order to achieve this personalization, we must learn about how good each question is, while simultaneously giving students good questions. Multi-armed bandits are a popular technique for sequential decision making under uncertainty. Due to their online nature and their ability to balance the trade-off between exploitation and exploration, multi-armed bandits lend themselves naturally to this problem of adaptively selecting questions in education software. However, due to the complexity of the educational problem, standard approaches to multi-armed bandits cannot be applied directly. In this thesis variants of the multi-armed bandit problem specifically motivated by the issues arising in the educational domain are considered. Particular focus will be placed on ton the statistical and mathematical foundations of such approaches.},

This assumption is often violated in practice (e.g., in recommendation systems), where the reward of an arm may change whenever is selected, i.e., rested bandit setting. In this paper, we consider the non-parametric rotting bandit setting, where rewards can only decrease. We introduce the filtering on expanding window average (FEWA) algorithm that constructs moving averages of increasing windows to identify arms that are more likely to return high rewards when pulled once more. We prove that for an unknown horizon T, and without any knowledge on the decreasing behavior of the K arms, FEWA achieves problem-dependent regret bound of {\$}O(\backslashlog(KT)){\$}, and a problem-independent one of {\$}O(\backslashsqrt(KT)){\$}. Our result substantially improves over the algorithm of Levine et al. (2017), which suffers regret {\$}O(K{\^{}}(1/3) T{\^{}}(2/3){\$}. FEWA also matches known bounds for the stochastic bandit setting, thus showing that the rotting bandits are not harder. Finally, we report simulations confirming the theoretical improvements of FEWA.},

abstract = {Learning to act in an unknown partially observable domain is a difficult variant of the reinforcement learning paradigm. Research in the area has focused on model-free methods --- methods that learn a policy without learning a model of the world. When sensor noise increases, model-free methods provide less accurate policies. The model-based approach --- learning a POMDP model of the world, and computing an optimal policy for the learned model --- may generate superior results in the presence of sensor noise, but learning and solving a model of the environment is a difficult problem. We have previously shown how such a model can be obtained from the learned policy of model-free methods, but this approach implies a distinction between a learning phase and an acting phase that is undesirable. In this paper we present a novel method for learning a POMDP model online, based on McCallums' Utile Suffix Memory (USM), in conjunction with an approximate policy obtained using an incremental POMDP solver. We show that the incrementally improving policy provides superior results to the original USM algorithm, especially in the presence of increasing sensor and action noise.},

@inproceedings{teng2018interactive,
abstract = {The arise of E-learning systems has led to an anytime-anywhere-learning environment for everyone by providing various online courses and tests. However, due to the lack of teacher-student interaction, such ubiquitous learning is generally not as effective as offline classes. In traditional offline courses, teachers facilitate real-time interaction to teach students in accordance with personal aptitude from students' feedback in classes. Without the interruption of instructors, it is difficult for users to be aware of personal unknowns. In this paper, we address an important issue on the exploration of 'user unknowns' from an interactive question-answering process in E-learning systems. A novel interactive learning system, called CagMab, is devised to interactively recommend questions with a round-by-round strategy, which contributes to applications such as a conversational bot for self-evaluation. The flow enables users to discover their weakness and further helps them to progress. In fact, despite its importance, discovering personal unknowns remains a challenging problem in E-learning systems. Even though formulating the problem with the multi-armed bandit framework provides a solution, it often leads to suboptimal results for interactive unknowns recommendation as it simply relies on the contextual features of answered questions. Note that each question is associated with concepts and similar concepts are likely to be linked manually or systematically, which naturally forms the concept graphs. Mining the rich relationships among users, questions and concepts could be potentially helpful in providing better unknowns recommendation. To this end, in this paper, we develop a novel interactive learning framework by borrowing strengths from concept-aware graph embedding for learning user unknowns. Our experimental studies on real data show that the proposed framework can effectively discover user unknowns in an interactive fashion for the recommendation in E-learning systems.},

Woodroofe's motivating application was clinical trials whereas modern interest in this problem was driven to a great extent by problems on the internet, such as online ad and online news article placement. We have now come full circle because contextual bandits provide a natural framework for sequential decision making in mobile health. We will survey the contextual bandits literature with a focus on modifications needed to adapt existing approaches to the mobile health setting. We discuss specific challenges in this direction such as: good initialization of the learning algorithm, finding interpretable policies, assessing usefulness of tailoring variables, computational considerations, robustness to failure of assumptions, and dealing with variables that are costly to acquire and missing.},

@article{traca2015regulating,
abstract = {In retail, there are predictable yet dramatic time-dependent patterns in customer behavior, such as periodic changes in the number of visitors, or increases in visitors just before major holidays. The current paradigm of multi-armed bandit analysis does not take these known patterns into account. This means that for applications in retail, where prices are fixed for periods of time, current bandit algorithms will not suffice. This work provides a remedy that takes the time-dependent patterns into account, and we show how this remedy is implemented in the UCB and {\{}$\backslash$epsilon{\}}-greedy methods and we introduce a new policy called the variable arm pool method. In the corrected methods, exploitation (greed) is regulated over time, so that more exploitation occurs during higher reward periods, and more exploration occurs in periods of low reward. In order to understand why regret is reduced with the corrected methods, we present a set of bounds that provide insight into why we would want to exploit during periods of high reward, and discuss the impact on regret. Our proposed methods perform well in experiments, and were inspired by a high-scoring entry in the Exploration and Exploitation 3 contest using data from Yahoo! Front Page. That entry heavily used time-series methods to regulate greed over time, which was substantially more effective than other contextual bandit methods.},

abstract = {Multi-armed bandit problems (MABPs) are a special type of optimal control problem well suited to model resource allocation under uncertainty in a wide variety of contexts. Since the first publication of the optimal solution of the classic MABP by a dynamic index rule, the bandit literature quickly diversified and emerged as an active research topic. Across this literature, the use of bandit models to optimally design clinical trials became a typical motivating application, yet little of the resulting theory has ever been used in the actual design and analysis of clinical trials. To this end, we review two MABP decision-theoretic approaches to the optimal allocation of treatments in a clinical trial: the infinite-horizon Bayesian Bernoulli MABP and the finite-horizon variant. These models possess distinct theoretical properties and lead to separate allocation rules in a clinical trial design context. We evaluate their performance compared to other allocation rules, including fixed randomization. Our results indicate that bandit approaches offer significant advantages, in terms of assigning more patients to better treatments, and severe limitations, in terms of their resulting statistical power. We propose a novel bandit-based patient allocation rule that overcomes the issue of low power, thus removing a potential barrier for their use in practice.},

We compare a family of IRT-based proficiency estimation methods to Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), a recently proposed recurrent neural network model with promising initial results. We evaluate how well each model predicts a student's future response given previous responses using two publicly available and one proprietary data set. We find that IRT-based methods consistently matched or outperformed DKT across all data sets at the finest level of content granularity that was tractable for them to be trained on. A hierarchical extension of IRT that captured item grouping structure performed best overall. When data sets included non-trivial autocorrelations in student response patterns, a temporal extension of IRT improved performance over standard IRT while the RNN-based method did not. We conclude that IRT-based models provide a simpler, better-performing alternative to existing RNN-based models of student interaction data while also affording more interpretability and guarantees due to their formulation as Bayesian probabilistic models.},

With the booming development of deep learning and large-scale artificial neural networks, there have been empirical successes in a number of machine learning and data mining applications, including student knowledge modeling. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), a pioneer algorithm that utilizes recurrent neural networks to model student learning, reports substantial improvements in prediction performance. To help the EDM community better understand the promising techniques of deep learning, we examine DKT alongside two well-studied models for knowledge modeling, PFA and BKT. In addition to sharing a primer on the internal computational structures of DKT, we also report on potential issues that arise from data formatting. We take steps to reproduce the experiments of Deep Knowledge Tracing by implementing a DKT algorithm using Google's TensorFlow framework; we also reproduce similar results on new datasets. We determine that the DKT findings don't hold an overall edge when compared to the PFA model, when applied to properly prepared datasets that are limited to main (i.e. non-scaffolding) questions. More importantly, during the investigation of DKT, we not only discovered a data quality issue in a public available data set, but we also detected a vulnerability of DKT at how it handles multiple skill sequences.},

In addition, the proposed algorithm enjoys improved regret guarantees in two intermediate regimes: the moderately contaminated stochastic regime defined by Seldin and Slivkins [22] and the stochastically constrained adversary studied by Wei and Luo [26]. The algorithm also obtains adversarial and stochastic optimality in the utility-based dueling bandit setting.
